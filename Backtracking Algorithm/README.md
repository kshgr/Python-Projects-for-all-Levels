# Backtracking Algorithm

Algorithm to find a predefined string by iterating through a list of probable elements (words list).

## What is backtracking?

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination in order to solve a computational problem. 

## More Ideas?

- Make initial string more complex
- Add special characters and numbers to key-list.
